To start the datafeed:
./RatePrinter start

Datafeed only starts if there is an X-server running, this is because RatePrinter.exe is written in Visual Basic (running under wine) and that it requires a GUI even though it doesn't use it.

To see what's going on

tail -f log.txt


To stop it (might have delays if there is work going on):
./RatePrinter stop
